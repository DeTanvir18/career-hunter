## The Career Hunter
***
I have made this react project for job seekers. It is a job seeking site for an the company "The Career Hunter". Of course, it's dynamic. A visitor can:
* See the the latest jobs specially jobs from IT sectors
* After seeing the jobs, one can see the the details of that job
* After seeing the details, a user can apply for that job
* Visitors themselves can add any job as an employer if there's permission 
* They can see the jobs they added, also the jobs they applied for
* It is responsive, so he can use and see updates from mobile
* So, a user can post jobs, search & apply jobs according to their demands

## The Server
* The site receives data from a live server using MongoDB Database
* The server generates all the data dynamically to the site
